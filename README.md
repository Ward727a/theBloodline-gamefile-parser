# theBloodline-gamefile-parser

## What it is?
This little tool is to parse gamefile that you can get from FModel to a more human-readable text.

## How to use it?
- 1 - Go to the file you want to parse using FModel
- 2 - Copy the content of the file
- 3 - Create a json file somewhere on your computer
- 4 - Open the tool (**WARNING: You need to have "index.html" AND "main.js" in the same file to make it work!**)
- 5 - Upload your file
- 6 - Submit and wait 2ms
- 7 - Copy the by selecting it all.. or just by pressing "Copy to Clipboard"
- 8 - There you go, you have a readable game file type :)

Bonus:
- 7.1 - Download Obsidian if you don't have it
- 7.2 - Create a vault and/or a file
- 7.3 - Paste the copied content
- 7.4 - Select it all, and press "SHIFT + TAB"
- 7.5 - Now you have the readable game file, AND it's beautifull =D

## WOW IT'S UGLY
Yeah, I know, and to be honest: I don't really want to take 8 hours creating a webdesign, 
then adapt it in css for just a little tool like that, it's a tool I created in 5 hours MAX (without counting the time I take writing those lines)
so yeah, it's ugly, read the FYI :)

## I like it but I want to have *Your Amazing IdeaÂ©*
Well, ask me, and I will see if I can add it ;)
If it's really an gamechanger idea, then I will see to add you to a credits list.. somewhere
