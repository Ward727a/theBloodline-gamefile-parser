        FYI: <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The name of the properties is first, the type is second example: <br/>
                playerName - text <br/>
                here playerName is the name of the property and text is the type
            </li><br/>
            <li>
                If a type is surrounded with [[ ]] the it's a type from the game, example: <br/>
                PlayerItem - [[item]] <br/> <br/>
                The "item" type is not from Unreal Engine, it's a type created by the dev, so it's surrounded with [[ ]]<br/>
                Generally the name of the type is the name of the file that you need to search for to "decode" it
            </li><br/>
            <li>
                If you're using "Obsidian" and want the text to be a little more **beautiful** then once you pasted the text, <br/>select all of it then press "SHIFT + TAB", unselect it, then here is it, you have a beautifful **bullet list** =D
            </li><br/>
            <li>
                This tool was created in like... 5 hours or so? So it's clearly not perfect, if you have any suggestions, <br/>feel free to contact me on Discord!<br/><br/><br/>
                Ho and: I will probably not edit the style of the page, it's a little tool, BUT if you want to do it, feel free to do so, then ask me to push it, you will be credited for it =)
